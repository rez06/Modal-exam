In my JS file, I declare the cancel button, modal, NO and YES buttons.
I added a pointer cursor to the cancel button when the mouse is over it.
Added an addEventListener to show the modal window when the cancel button is clicked.
I added an addEventListener to hide the modal window when the NO button is clicked.
I added the last addEventListener to update the modal window and cancel button text when the yes button is clicked, and hide the modal window after 2 seconds.
